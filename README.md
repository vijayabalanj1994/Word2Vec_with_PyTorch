# Project Title: Word Embeddings with PyTorch and TorchText

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of word embeddings using PyTorch and TorchText. It covers various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including creating word embeddings with models like CBOW and Skip-Gram, training deep learning models, and visualizing results. The notebook leverages libraries like PyTorch, Gensim, and Matplotlib for effective implementation and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and preparation of target-context pairs using torchtext.
- **Word Embedding Models**: Implementation of CBOW and Skip-Gram models.
- **Custom Neural Networks**: Feed-forward neural networks using PyTorch's `nn.EmbeddingBag` and `nn.Linear`.
- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - Training models using custom datasets.
  - Visualization of training losses over epochs.
- **Word Similarity Search**: Finding similar words using cosine similarity.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Loading and utilizing pre-trained embeddings like GloVe.
- **Visualization**: Plotting embeddings and training metrics.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
